1) info_4.0mpc_dr3_128cls_wzspecn.dat - list of 128 clusters for which we have enough spectroscopic redshifts for estimating velocity dispersion, R200 and M200.

2) info_4.0mpc_dr3_128cls_wzspec.header - header of the file above

3) cluster.gals.sel.dens_zspec020_membership_probs_r200n.dat - galaxies (with spectroscopic redshifts) in the regions of the clusters listed in (1)

4) cluster.gals.sel.dens_zspec020_membership_probs_r200.header - header of the file above

5) info_rich05mpc_dr3_474cls_awp3n.dat - list of 474 clusters with zphot < 0.230, for which we got photometric membership estimates

The R200 values come from a scaling relation between richness and R200 (derived from spectroscopic data). When richness = 0.0 I set R200 = 0.15 Mpc and R200e = 0.10 Mpc. That was just for writing into this file. So, please ignore those R200 estimates. Actually, for very poor systems the R200 photometric estimate may be meaningless.

6) cluster.gals.sel.dens_zpt023_membership_probs_r200n.dat - galaxies in the regions of the 628 clusters listed in (5).

This file contains all galaxies within R200 (photometric estimate). For systems with very small estimates of R200 (< 0.30 Mpc) I set R200 to this value (0.30 Mpc).

The photometric membership classification for the galaxies above considered the training based on galaxies within R200 and having r <= 19.0. For this case, completeness and purity are C = 90.09 and P = 84.76.

7) cluster.gals.sel.dens_zpt023_membership_probs_r05mpcbn.dat - analogous to the file above (6), but having galaxies within 0.50 Mpc.

The photometric membership classification for the galaxies above considered the training based on galaxies within 0.50 Mpc and having r <= 19.0. For this case, completeness and purity are C = 92.85 and P = 88.72.

8) cluster.gals.sel.dens_zpt023_membership_probs_r05mpc.header - header of the files listed in (6) and (7).
